Boot Camp Homework 6

OBSERVABLE TRENDS

1. The maximum temperature forms a bit of a bell curve around the equator (with the highest temperatures being found at or near 0 latitude). The curve trend is more complete for latitudes -40 to 70 and less data exists for further outlying latitudes (possibly because there are few cities on or near the south pole).

2. Cities at the equator appear to have higher humidity, while humidity levels closer to the poles (-90, 90) are more varied.

3. Wind speed appears to be greater near the poles and slightly more concentrated at lower speeds as cities near the equator.
